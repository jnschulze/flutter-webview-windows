A [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) WebView plugin for Windows built on [Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/).


### Target platform requirements
- [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)
- Windows 10 1809+

### Development platform requirements
- Visual Studio 2019
- Windows 10 SDK 2004+ (10.0.19041.0)
- (recommended) nuget.exe in your $PATH *(The makefile attempts to download nuget if it's not installed, however, this fallback might not work in China)*

## Limitations
This plugin provides seamless composition of web-based contents with other Flutter widgets by rendering off-screen.

Unfortunately, [Microsoft Edge WebView2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/) doesn't currently have an explicit API for offscreen rendering.
In order to still be able to obtain a pixel buffer upon rendering a new frame, this plugin currently relies on the `Windows.Graphics.Capture` API provided by Windows 10.
The downside is that older Windows versions aren't currently supported.

Older Windows versions might still be targeted by using `BitBlt` for the time being.
